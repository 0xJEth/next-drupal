title: Preview Mode
excerpt: Configure preview mode for Drupal.
---

The Next Drupal module, paired with the `next-drupal` plugin, makes it easy to create [Next.js preview routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode).

To configure preview mode for an entity type, you must configure:

1. A **Next.js site**
2. A **site resolver** for the entity type
3. An **OAuth Consumer**.

A _site resolver_ tells Drupal how to resolve the preview URL for an entity. Site resolvers are flexible, can handle multiple sites and work with _entity reference_ fields.

## Configure a Next.js site

Start by creating a new Next.js site.

1. Visit _/admin/config/services/next_
2. Click **Add Next.js site**
3. Fill in the **Label**, **Base URL**, **Preview URL** and **Preview Secret** and click **Save**

## Configure a site resolver

Next, add a site resolver to your content type.

1. Visit _/admin/config/services/next/entity-types_
2. Click **Configure entity type**
3. Select the entity type from the list
4. Select a **Site resolver**
5. Click **Save**

If you visit an entity page, you should be able to see the Next.js site preview. See the `next-drupal` plugin for more information on how to configure preview mode on the Next.js site.

## Configure OAuth Client

To generate preview routes, the Next.js client uses the [Client credentials grant](https://oauth2.thephpleague.com/authorization-server/client-credentials-grant/) for authentication. This is made possible using the [Simple OAuth](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) module.

### Create a Drupal role

1. Create a new Drupal role (example `Next site`) by visiting _/admin/people/roles/add_
2. Give the role the following permission:

- Bypass content access control
- View all revisions
- Issue subrequests
- View user information

### Create a user

Add a new user at _/admin/people/create_ and assign it the role created above.

_Note: When the Next.js is authenticated, it will be authenticated as this user._

### Configure a consumer

1. Visit _/admin/config/people/simple_oauth_
2. Click **Generate keys** to generate encryption keys for tokens
3. Visit _/admin/config/services/consumer/add_
4. Fill in a **Label**, **User** (select the user created above), **Secret** and under **Scopes**, select the role created above.
5. Click **Save**

_Important: note the client id (uuid) and the secret. This is going to be used as environment variables for the Next.js site._
