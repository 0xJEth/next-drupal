excerpt: Demo for Next.js sites powered by Drupal on the backend.
---

## Examples

The following demo sites are built from a single Drupal backend, Next.js for the frontend and styled with [Reflexjs](https://github.com/reflexjs/reflexjs).

- Blog: http://next-example-blog.vercel.app/
- Marketing (with paragaphs): http://next-example-marketing.vercel.app/

## How to run the Demo

To access the Drupal site and test the preview mode, you can clone this repository and run the demo sites on your local machine.

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/arshad/next-drupal.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
yarn && composer install -d ./examples/drupal-site
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

```
cp examples/example-blog/.env.example examples/example-blog/.env.local
cp examples/example-marketing/.env.example examples/example-marketing/.env.local
```

4. Generate a certificate for localhost (this is required to run your local sites with HTTPS for preview mode)

```
openssl req -x509 -out examples/certificates/localhost.crt -keyout examples/certificates/localhost.key \
 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
 -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <(\
 printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")

```

Double-click on the certificate to add it to your keychain.

5. Then run `yarn dev` from the root to start the _Drupal_ site and the _Next.js_ sites.

```
yarn dev

```

6. Login to the _Drupal_ site at http://localhost:8080 with **username: admin** and **password: admin**.

7. Visit _/admin/config/people/simple_oauth_ to generate OAuth encryption keys. Enter `../oauth-keys` for the directory.

8. Visit _/admin/content_ to add, edit and preview content.

The blog site runs on [https://localhost:3030](https://localhost:3030) and the marketing site runs on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).
