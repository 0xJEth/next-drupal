In this release of Next 1.3, the Drupal module, and Next-Drupal 1.5, we're introducing _Preview URL Generators_.

Preview URL Generators are used for generating URLs for preview mode with encrypted secrets.

Compared to the preview secrets used in previous releases, the new secrets are:

- Generated per requests
- Encrypted and not re-usabled
- Scoped to the current URL and user
- With expiration dates
- Validated by Drupal (no client validation)
- Pluggable (bring your own secret generator)

Upgrading to Next 1.3 is easy. See the upgrade guide [here](/docs/upgrade-guide).

Note: You should also upgrade to the latest `next-drupal` to use the new encrypted secrets.
