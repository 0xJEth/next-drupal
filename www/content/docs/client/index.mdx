It is a replacement for functional helpers such as `getResource`, `getResourceCollection` ...etc.

## Features

1. Customizable JSON:API client for data fetching.
2. Helpers to fetching resources, menus, views and search indices.
3. Support for custom auth (`Bearer`, `Basic` or bring your own).
4. Support for custom serializers.
5. Support for custom fetcher.
6. Support for cached resources (memory cache, redis...etc).
7. Improved error messages.

## Usage

```ts
import { Experimental_DrupalClient as DrupalClient } from "next-drupal"

const drupal = new DrupalClient("https://example.com")

// Fetch articles.
const articles = await drupal.getResourceCollection("node--article")
```
