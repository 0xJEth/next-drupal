title: Fetcher
excerpt: Using a custom fetcher with DrupalClient.
---

<Callout icon="⚠️">

The `DrupalClient` is available in `next-drupal ^1.3.0` as **experimental**.

</Callout>

The `DrupalClient` uses Next.js polyfilled `fetch` as the default fetcher.

You can provide your own using the [`fetcher`](/docs/client/configuration#fetcher) option.

### Example

Here's how you can replace the default fetcher with [cross-fetch](https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch).

<Callout icon="⚠️">

We're using **cross-fetch** instead of **node-fetch** because it is compatible with the built-in fetch and uses the same signature.

</Callout>

```ts title=lib/drupal.ts
import { Experiment_DrupalClient as DrupalClient } from "next-drupal"
import crossFetch from "cross-fetch"

const fetcher = (url, options) => {
  const { withAuth, ...opts } = options

  if (withAuth) {
    // Make additional requests to fetch a bearer token
    // Or any other Authorization headers.
  }

  return crossFetch(url, {
    ...opts,
    // Pass in additional options. Example: agent.
  })
}

export const drupal = new DrupalClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUPAL_BASE_URL,
  {
    fetcher,
  }
)
```
