2. Helpers to fetching resources, menus, views and search indices.
3. Helpers for JSON:API write operations (POST, PATCH, and DELETE)
4. Support for custom auth (`Bearer`, `Basic`, `Next-Auth` or bring your own).
5. Support for custom serializers.
6. Support for custom fetcher.
7. Support for cached resources (memory cache, redis...etc).
8. Improved error messages.

## Usage

```ts
import { Experimental_DrupalClient as DrupalClient } from "next-drupal"

// Create a new DrupalClient.
const drupal = new DrupalClient("https://example.com")

// Fetch articles.
const articles = await drupal.getResourceCollection("node--article")
