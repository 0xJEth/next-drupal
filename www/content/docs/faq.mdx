## Can I use next-drupal with Drupal 8 or Drupal 9?

Yes. Next.js for Drupal works with both Drupal 8 and Drupal 9.

Some features such as [filter by site id](/docs/data-fetching/filter-by-site) is only available in Drupal _9.3.x_.

## Does it work without access tokens?

Yes. Access tokens are only required for previewing unpublished entities and revisions.

You can use Next.js for Drupal without access tokens.

## How do I customize the /jsonapi prefix?

You can use the `DRUPAL_JSONAPI_PREFIX` environment variable.

```
DRUPAL_JSONAPI_PREFIX=/api
```

## Does it work with GraphQL?

The `next` Drupal module works with both JSON:API and GraphQL.

If you implement preview mode in your Next + GraphQL site and tell `next` module how to resolve it, it will display your preview in an iframe.

The `next-drupal` package works with JSON:API **only**.

## Something is not working. Help?

You can get help in the [issue queue](https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal/issues) on GitHub or in the #nextjs channel on [Drupal Slack](https://drupal.slack.com/archives/C01E36BMU72).
