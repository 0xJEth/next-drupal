excerpt: Frequently Asked Questions about Next.js for Drupal
---

## Which Drupal versions are supported?

Next.js for Drupal works with both Drupal 8 and Drupal 9.

## Does it work without authentication?

Yes. Authentication is only required for previewing unpublished entities and revisions.

You can use Next.js for Drupal for pulling public JSON:API data and building static pages without authentication.

## Does it work with GraphQL?

The `next` Drupal module works with both JSON:API and GraphQL.

If you implement preview mode in your Next + GraphQL site and tell `next` module how to resolve it, it will display your preview in an iframe.

The `next-drupal` package works with **JSON:API only**.

## Something is not working. Help?

You can get help in the [issue queue](https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal/issues) on GitHub or in the #nextjs channel on [Drupal Slack](https://drupal.slack.com/archives/C01E36BMU72).
