Now that we have completed the Drupal configuration, we can create our Next.js project.

We are going to use the [basic starter](https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal/tree/master/starters/basic-starter).

---

## Create Project

Run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

```sh
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/chapter-three/next-drupal-basic-starter
```

---

## Connect Drupal

To connect the Next.js project to Drupal, we use [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Fill in the following **Environment variables**:

```txt title=.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUPAL_BASE_URL=http://example.com
NEXT_IMAGE_DOMAIN=example
```

---

## Start Development Server

To start the Next.js development server, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.
