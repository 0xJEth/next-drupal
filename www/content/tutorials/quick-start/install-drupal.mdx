## Install Drupal

Start by creating a new Drupal site using composer.

If you have an existing Drupal site, you can skip to the next part.

```sh
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal-site
```

Once this is done, you can open the site and proceed with installation.

## Add Next.js module

Run the following command to install the [Next.js](https://drupal.org/project/next) module and dependencies.

```sh
composer require drupal/next
```
