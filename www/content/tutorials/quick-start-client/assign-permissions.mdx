On the Drupal site, visit `/admin/people/permissions/anonymous` and assign the **Issue subrequests** permission to the **Anonymous user** role:

We do this because during the build phase, most of the requests for pages are anonymous requests. By assigning this permission, you can significantly decrease your site's build time.

If you would rather keep requests authenticated, you can use the [`withAuth`](/docs/client/configuration#withauth) options.
