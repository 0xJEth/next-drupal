The Basic authentication is relatively easy to set up. It requires less configuration and uses username and password as credentials.

---

## 1. Create Role

1. Visit `/admin/people/roles`.
2. Click on **+ Add role**.
3. Fill in the **Role name**. Example: _Next.js Site_.

---

## 2. Assign Permissions

Next, assign the following permissions to the newly created role.

- Bypass content access control
- Issue subrequests
- View user information

<Callout>

We are assigning the _Bypass content access control_ permission to allow Next.js to access unpublished content and revisions.

You can safely skip this permission if you do not need to preview unpublished content.

</Callout>

---

## 3. Create User

Add a new user at `/admin/people/create` and assign it the role we created above.

---

## 4. Enable module

Visit `/admin/modules` and enable the **Basic Auth** module.

---

## 5. Connect Drupal

To connect the Next.js project to Drupal, we use [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

Fill in the following variables in your `.env.local` file.

```txt title=.env.local
# Authentication (Basic)
DRUPAL_USERNAME=
DRUPAL_PASSWORD=
```

This is the username and password of the user we created above.

---

## 6. Update DrupalClient

Update the `DrupalClient` to use the **Basic** authentication header.

```ts title=lib/drupal.ts
import { DrupalClient } from "next-drupal"

export const drupal = new DrupalClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DRUPAL_BASE_URL,
  {
    auth: {
      username: process.env.DRUPAL_USERNAME,
      password: process.env.DRUPAL_PASSWORD,
    },
  }
)
```
