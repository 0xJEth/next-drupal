The Next.js module, paired with the `next-drupal` plugin, makes it easy to create [Next.js preview routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode).

To handle preview routes, we need to configure authentication.

The `DrupalClient` works with several authentication methods. We are going to look into two methods:

1. **Basic** tokens using the _basic_auth_ module.
2. **Bearer** tokens using the [_simple_oauth_](https://drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) module.

_Only one of the authentication methods is required for Preview Mode._
