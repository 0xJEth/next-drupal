The Next.js module, paired with the `next-drupal` plugin, makes it easy to create [Next.js preview routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode).

We use an OAuth consumer to access preview routes.

Before we can create an OAuth consumer, we need to create a new role and a user for OAuth scopes.

## Create Role

1. Visit _/admin/people/roles_.
2. Click on **+ Add role**.
3. Fill in the **Role name**. Example: _Next.js Site_.

## Assign Permissions

Next, assign the following permissions to the newly created role.

- Bypass content access control
- Issue subrequests
- View user information

<Callout>

We are assigning the _Bypass content access control_ permission to allow Next.js to access unpublished content and revisions.

You can safely skip this permission if you do not need to preview unpublished content.

</Callout>

## Create User

Add a new user at `/admin/people/create` and assign it the role we created above.
