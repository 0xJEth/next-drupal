You have now successfully install, configure and connect a Next.js site to your Drupal site. ðŸŽ‰

## Need help?

We understand there's more than a few steps to properly configure preview mode.

It is built this way for flexibility.

With the current setup, you can easily configure one Drupal backend and serve multiple Next.js sites (content hub).

You maintain control on which content is pushed to which sites and how.
